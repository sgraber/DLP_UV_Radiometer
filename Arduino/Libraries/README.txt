Requirements:

Install LinkedList[1] and Gaussian[2] to your Arduino library folder before compiling and using.  These two libraries provide a powerful *statistics-based* moving average for this sketch using Gaussian averages. Results are FAR superior than using a standard moving average where you add numbers to an array and average the list.  Use the latest release from the URLs below. 

NOTE: /Gaussian and /LinkedList are placed here for convenience, but may not be the latest release any longer.
